Final Process for Sheet Metal Part Pose Estimation
1. Image Acquisition & Preprocessing

Capture RGB image from Intel RealSense camera
Apply color thresholding (cv2.threshold()) to separate aluminum parts from background
Optional: Apply noise reduction with Gaussian blur (cv2.GaussianBlur())
Optional: Enhance contrast with histogram equalization (cv2.equalizeHist()) if lighting varies

2. Contour Detection

Find all contours in the binary image (cv2.findContours())
Filter contours by area (cv2.contourArea()) to remove noise and background

Keep contours within expected size range based on 5"×3" parts
Expected area range: approximately [known_min_area × 0.7, known_max_area × 1.3]



3. Template Preparation (one-time setup)

Convert CAD/DXF file to binary image
Extract template contour (cv2.findContours())
Save template contour for matching

4. Contour Matching

For each detected contour:

Calculate match score with template using cv2.matchShapes()
Store match scores in descending order (lower score = better match)
Keep contours with match score below threshold (e.g., < 0.3)



5. Handling Overlapping Parts

Apply convexity defects detection (cv2.convexityDefects()) to identify potential overlaps
For overlapping regions, use watershed algorithm (cv2.watershed()) for segmentation
If watershed fails, match partial contours against template with higher threshold

6. Pose Estimation

For each matched contour:

Calculate moments (cv2.moments())
Compute centroid (x,y) from moments:
CopyM = cv2.moments(contour)
cx = int(M["m10"] / M["m00"])
cy = int(M["m01"] / M["m00"])

Determine orientation (yaw) using minimum area rectangle:
Copyrect = cv2.minAreaRect(contour)
angle = rect[2]

Set roll and pitch to 0 (flat part assumption)



7. Coordinate Transformation

Transform camera coordinates to robot base coordinates using a predefined calibration matrix
Output the final pose data: [x, y, 0, 0, 0, yaw] for each detected part

8. Result Ranking

Sort detected parts by confidence (match score)
Prioritize fully visible parts over partially occluded ones
Return position and orientation of highest confidence part first

Key Algorithms/Functions Used:

Thresholding: cv2.threshold() or cv2.adaptiveThreshold()
Contour detection: cv2.findContours()
Contour filtering: cv2.contourArea(), cv2.arcLength()
Shape matching: cv2.matchShapes()
Moments calculation: cv2.moments()
Orientation estimation: cv2.minAreaRect() or cv2.fitEllipse()
Overlap handling: cv2.watershed() and cv2.convexityDefects()

This approach provides a robust MVP solution using primarily OpenCV functions, with appropriate fallbacks for handling partial occlusion and overlapping parts.
